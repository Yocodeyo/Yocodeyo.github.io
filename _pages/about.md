<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a PhD student in the National University of Singapore (NUS) WING lab with research interests in human-centered and socially aware Natural Language Processing. I am fortunately supervised by [**Prof Kan Min-Yen**](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/) from NUS, [**Dr Nancy F. Chen**](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r/i2r-profiles/nancychen) from ASTAR, and [**Prof Shafiq Joty**](https://raihanjoty.github.io/) from Salesforce. I am also having great collaborations with SALT Lab under the advice of [**Prof Diyi Yang**](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/) from Stanford University. I graduated with a bachelor in NUS.

My research interests include **(1) Human-Centric and Data-Centric NLP**, **(2) NLP for Social Good** and **（3）Socially Aware NLP System**. I have published papers at the top tier NLP conferences like ACL and EMNLP.

I like playing piano and table tennis. I also like to travel and explore the world/good food!😋 Recently I'm learning magic tricks🎩

**(2)**  [CoAnnotating: Uncertainty-Guided Work Allocation between Human and Large Language Models for Data Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15638)

[<strong>*EMNLP Main Conference*</strong>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15638) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='1fXM4wUAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC'></span></strong>

- This work propose CoAnnotating, a novel paradigm for Human-LLM co-annotation of unstructured texts at scale. Under this framework, we utilize uncertainty to estimate LLMs' annotation capability. Our empirical study shows CoAnnotating to be an effective means to allocate work from results on different datasets, with up to 21% performance improvement over random baseline.

**(1)**  [Inducing Positive Perspectives with Text Reframing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02952)

Caleb Ziems, **Minzhi Li** (equal contribution), Anthony Zhang, Diyi Yang

[<strong>*ACL 2022 Main Conference*</strong>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02952) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='1fXM4wUAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC'></span></strong>
- We introduce a large-scale benchmark, Positive Psychology Frames, with 8,349 sentence pairs and 12,755 structured annotations to explain positive reframing in terms of six theoretically-motivated reframing strategies. Then we evaluate a set of state-of-the-art text style transfer models, and conclude by discussing key challenges and directions for future work.
