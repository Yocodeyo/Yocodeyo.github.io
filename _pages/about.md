<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a a PhD student in the National University of Singapore (NUS) WING lab with research interests in human-centered and socially aware Natural Language Processing. I am fortunately supervised by [**Prof Kan Min-Yen**](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/) from NUS, [**Dr Nancy F. Chen**](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r/i2r-profiles/nancychen) from ASTAR, and [**Prof Shafiq Joty**](https://raihanjoty.github.io/) from Salesforce. I am also having great collaborations with SALT Lab under the advice of Prof Diyi Yang from Stanford University. I graduated with a bachelor in NUS.

My research interest includes **(1) Human-Centric and Data-Centric NLP**, **(2) NLP for Social Good** and **Ôºà4ÔºâSocially Aware NLP System**. I have published papers at the top tier NLP conferences like ACL and EMNLP.

I like playing piano and table tennis. I also like to travel and explore the world/good food!

- This work propose CoAnnotating, a novel paradigm for Human-LLM co-annotation of unstructured texts at scale. Under this framework, we utilize uncertainty to estimate LLMs' annotation capability. Our empirical study shows CoAnnotating to be an effective means to allocate work from results on different datasets, with up to 21% performance improvement over random baseline.

- The absolute configurations of (25R)-antcin K,(25R)-antcin A, versisponic acid D, and (25R)-antcin C were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD). 
- Antcin A was shown to suppress pro-inflammatory biomolecule release via the down-regulation of iNOS and COX-2 expression through the NF-Œ∫B pathway while the mRNA levels of IL-1Œ≤, TNF-Œ± and IL-6 were also decreased.

- The reaction products of five flavonoids (apigenin, quercetin, naringenin, ampelopsin, and epicatechin) with hypochlorous acid and found that primary chlorination reaction occurred on the A-ring (C6 or C8) and/or C-rings but not on B-rings were characterized. 
- The hydroxyl groups in the A-ring and B-ring can enhance the scavenging capacity, whereas the C(2)C(3) double bond has a negative impact on the HClO scavenging capacity.
